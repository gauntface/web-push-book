# Triggering Push Messages

When it comes to sending a push message it can be relatively simple if you use
a library or you can write the server side completely on your own which can be
OK if you are relatively happy with JSON Web Tokens and Encryption.

In this chapter we'll first look at using a Node.js library to send a message
and I'll highlight where you can find alternative libraries.

Then we'll look at the steps you can take if you want to do it yourself. This
might be of interest to you, or it might be somethng you want to skip. For what
it's worth, I'd say 90% of people will want to use a library.
