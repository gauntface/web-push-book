This book is for anyone looking to learn about push notifications on the web.

I started working on web push when Chrome first added support. There have been quite a few changes since then, but the APIs have stabilized across Chrome and Firefox, so itâ€™s the perfect time for people to learn about push notification on the web.

If you spot mistakes, code errors, or simple typos, please raise issues or contribute on Github where this content lives.

Finally, a massive thank you to all the contributors who have helped with this book.
