# Introduction

This book is for anyone looking to learn about adding push notifications into
their web site / web app.

I wanted to put this together this information for push was scattered and
kept on falling out of date and patching up blog posts didn't seem like
it would work overly well, so I thought I'd try and create a central
resource that anyone can help change by [raising
issues](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/issues) or [creating
a pull request](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/) to keep
everything up to date and accurate.

I started working on push since the early days of Chrome's support and been
following the changes and growth since. There have been quite a few changes
to the earliest implementations, but the API's have reached a reasonable point
of stability across browsers that now is a good time to jot down the best
practices and approaches to implementing push on the web..

I'm pretty certain that areas of the push API will change and as they do
I'll update this book and create another release which you'll be able to
find on [Github](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases), which also
has an [RSS feed](https://github.com/gauntface/push-book/releases.atom).
